# Problem 1 
# Equivalent Resistance Using Graph Theory

## 1. Algorithm Description

*Notes*: To calculate the equivalent resistance of a circuit using graph theory, we represent the circuit as a graph where:
- **Nodes** are junctions in the circuit.
- **Edges** are resistors, with weights equal to their resistance values (in ohms, $\Omega$).

The goal is to simplify the graph iteratively by identifying series and parallel connections until we’re left with a single edge between the input and output nodes, whose weight is the equivalent resistance.

### Algorithm Steps
1. **Represent the Circuit as a Graph**:
   - Nodes represent junctions.
   - Edges represent resistors with weights as resistance values.
   - Identify the input (source) and output (sink) nodes between which we calculate the equivalent resistance.

2. **Iterative Simplification**:
   - **Series Reduction**: If a node has exactly two neighbors (degree 2), the resistors are in series. Replace the two resistors $R_1$ and $R_2$ with a single resistor $R_{\text{eq}} = R_1 + R_2$, removing the intermediate node.
   - **Parallel Reduction**: If there are multiple edges between two nodes, the resistors are in parallel. Replace them with a single resistor using the parallel formula: for resistors $R_1, R_2, \ldots, R_n$, the equivalent resistance is:
     $$\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{R_n} \implies R_{\text{eq}} = \left( \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{R_i} \right)^{-1}$$
   - Repeat until the graph is reduced to a single edge between the source and sink.

3. **Handle Complex Configurations**:
   - **Nested Series/Parallel**: The algorithm naturally handles nested configurations by repeatedly applying series and parallel reductions.
   - **Cycles**: For graphs with cycles (like a Wheatstone bridge), we may need additional techniques like the delta-star transformation to break cycles into simpler series/parallel forms.

*Notes*: This approach simplifies the graph step by step, ensuring we can handle arbitrary configurations, though cycles may require extra steps.

## 2. Implementation in Python

*Notes*: We’ll use Python with the `networkx` library to represent and manipulate the graph. The implementation will:
- Accept a circuit graph as input.
- Iteratively reduce the graph using series and parallel rules.
- Output the equivalent resistance.
- Test on three examples: simple series, simple parallel, and a nested configuration.

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    """Find a node with degree 2 for series reduction."""
    for node in G.nodes():
        if G.degree(node) == 2:
            return node
    return None

def find_parallel_edges(G):
    """Find a pair of nodes with multiple edges for parallel reduction."""
    for u, v in G.edges():
        if G.number_of_edges(u, v) > 1:
            return u, v
    return None

def reduce_graph(G, source, sink):
    """Reduce the graph to find equivalent resistance between source and sink."""
    G = G.copy()  # Work on a copy of the graph
    steps = []  # To store steps for explanation

    while G.number_of_nodes() > 2 or G.number_of_edges() > 1:
        # Step 1: Check for parallel edges
        parallel = find_parallel_edges(G)
        if parallel:
            u, v = parallel
            edges = list(G[u][v].items())
            resistances = [data['weight'] for _, data in edges]

            u, v = neighbors

            G.remove_node(node)
            G.add_edge(u, v, weight=R_eq)
            continue

        # If no reductions are possible, the graph may have cycles
        break

    # Final resistance between source and sink
    if G.number_of_edges() == 1 and G.has_edge(source, sink):

  - **Example 2**: Two resistors in parallel (2 Ω and 3 Ω).
  - **Example 3**: A series connection of two parallel pairs (two 2 Ω resistors in parallel, in series with two 3 Ω resistors in parallel).

## 3. Description of Results on Test Cases

*Notes*: Let’s analyze the results for each example.

- **Example 1: Simple Series**:
  - Graph: A → B (2 Ω) → C (3 Ω).
  - Reduction: Node B has degree 2, so the resistors are in series.
    - $R_{\text{eq}} = 2 + 3 = 5$ Ω.
  - Output: The algorithm correctly finds $R_{\text{eq}} = 5$ Ω.
  - Steps: “Series reduction at node B: 2 + 3 -> 5.00 Ω”, “Final equivalent resistance: 5.00 Ω”.

- **Example 2: Simple Parallel**:
  - Graph: A → B (2 Ω and 3 Ω in parallel).
  - Reduction: Two edges between A and B, so they’re in parallel.
    - $\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq}}} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{5}{6}$
    - $R_{\text{eq}} = \frac{6}{5} = 1.2$ Ω.
  - Output: The algorithm correctly finds $R_{\text{eq}} = 1.2$ Ω.
  - Steps: “Parallel reduction between A and B: [2, 3] -> 1.20 Ω”, “Final equivalent resistance: 1.20 Ω”.

- **Example 3: Nested Configuration**:
  - Graph: A → B (two 2 Ω resistors in parallel) → C (two 3 Ω resistors in parallel).
  - Reduction:
    - First, parallel between A and B: $\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq1}}} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1$, so $R_{\text{eq1}} = 1$ Ω.
    - Second, parallel between B and C: $\frac{1}{R_{\text{eq2}}} = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}$, so $R_{\text{eq2}} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5$ Ω.
    - Now, A → B (1 Ω) → C (1.5 Ω), in series: $R_{\text{final}} = 1 + 1.5 = 2.5$ Ω.
  - Output: The algorithm correctly finds $R_{\text{final}} = 2.5$ Ω.
  - Steps: “Parallel reduction between A and B: [2, 2] -> 1.00 Ω”, “Parallel reduction between B and C: [3, 3] -> 1.50 Ω”, “Series reduction at node B: 1 + 1.5 -> 2.50 Ω”, “Final equivalent resistance: 2.50 Ω”.

*Notes*: The algorithm handles nested configurations by applying reductions iteratively, first simplifying parallel pairs, then combining the results in series.

## 4. Analysis of Algorithm Efficiency and Improvements

*Notes*:
- **Efficiency**:
  - **Time Complexity**: Each reduction (series or parallel) removes at least one node or edge. In a graph with $N$ nodes and $E$ edges, the number of reductions is at most $N + E$, and each reduction involves checking neighbors (constant time with proper data structures). Using `networkx`, operations like finding neighbors are $O(1)$ on average, but iterating over nodes/edges makes the overall complexity roughly $O((N + E)^2)$ in the worst case due to repeated traversals.
  - **Space Complexity**: $O(N + E)$ to store the graph.

- **Limitations**:
  - The algorithm fails for graphs with cycles that can’t be reduced by series/parallel rules alone (e.g., a Wheatstone bridge). It stops when no further reductions are possible.

- **Potential Improvements**:
  - **Delta-Star Transformation**: For graphs with cycles, apply delta-star transformations to convert a delta (triangle) of resistors into a star (Y-shape), which may allow further series/parallel reductions.
  - **Kirchhoff’s Laws**: Use Kirchhoff’s current and voltage laws to set up a system of equations for node voltages, solving for the equivalent resistance directly (more general but computationally intensive).
  - **Optimization**: Use a more efficient graph traversal (e.g., DFS) to identify reducible patterns faster, or prioritize reductions to minimize iterations.

*Notes*: The current implementation is effective for series/parallel networks but needs extensions for non-reducible graphs.

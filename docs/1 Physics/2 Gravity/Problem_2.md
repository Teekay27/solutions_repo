# Problem 2: Escape Velocities and Cosmic Velocities

The concept of **escape velocity** is essential in understanding how a spacecraft can break free from a planetâ€™s gravitational pull. This leads us to the definitions of:

- **First Cosmic Velocity**: the minimum speed needed to enter a stable orbit around a planet.
- **Second Cosmic Velocity**: the speed required to escape the gravitational pull of a planet entirely.
- **Third Cosmic Velocity**: the speed needed to leave the gravitational influence of the entire solar system.

These concepts are foundational for launching satellites, sending missions to other planets, and envisioning potential interstellar travel.

---

The **first cosmic velocity** is given by:

$$
v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{R}}
$$

The **second cosmic velocity** is:

$$
v_2 = \sqrt{2} \cdot v_1 = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}
$$

The **third cosmic velocity**, required to leave the solar system from Earth, is estimated by:

$$
v_3 = \sqrt{v_{\text{esc, Earth}}^2 + v_{\text{orbital, Earth}}^2}
$$

Where:

- \( G = 6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{m}^3 \cdot \text{kg}^{-1} \cdot \text{s}^{-2} \) is the gravitational constant  
- \( M \) is the mass of the planet  
- \( R \) is the radius of the planet
